You will slowly learn more as you go and you definitely don't need to understand every line of code.\n\nStep 1\n--------\n\nThese notebooks contain places where you can execute code, like below.\n\nGive it a go. Click on the code below, then press `Run` in the toolbar above (or press __Shift+Enter__) to run the code."
